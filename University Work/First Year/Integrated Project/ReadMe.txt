This was the first integrated project I took part in.

The aim was to create a tower defence game. 

I was able to create the movement of enemies by having them travel across set nodes when spawned.

Turrets fire at the enemies and cause damage to them if hit.

If too many enemies reached the end of the map you would lose the game.

I failed to find a way to use a grid based spawning system, this led me to use set spawn points to spawn turrets.

Other bugs include the fact I ran out of time to integrate projectiles pointing to the enemies they were travelling towards.
