This project mainly focused on how to load/save an .XML file as a way of recording the state of a game. 

The game was a simple voxel based game which allowed the player to place several types of blocks and break existing blocks in a large matrix which was recorded in an .XML file.

The game also featured several methods of sorting an inventory system such as using a quick sort and merge sort among others.

Finally, a scene which focused on pathfinding was also created. I was able to implement breadth first searching for pathfinding but was unable to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding in time.
