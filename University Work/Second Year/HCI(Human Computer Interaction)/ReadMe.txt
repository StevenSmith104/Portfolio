This project was mainly focused on how to create a rapid prototype and as such a large portion of the final project is not functional and is there just to display the features which would exist in a final version.

We were tasked with creating an app which would promote recycling, my idea included rewarding points when an item was recycled.

The app included a leaderboard to promote competition in recycling.

It also included the ability to spend points on cosmetics for a character created in the app.

The app also contained several minigames to provide further amusement.
